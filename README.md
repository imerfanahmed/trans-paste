Two People Choose Apple Product
1. Rich who has a lot of money, and they just want to show them off!
2. Man who loves the ecosystem of apple.

ðŸ’« Now I am working for bringing the apples ecosystems feature for all windows and android users as well.

This application sends the androids' clipboard information to the windows or linux machine and vice-versa through network.

If anyone is interested to make this program better, you are welcome!

âœ… Need a java developer who can help me to do that as well.
